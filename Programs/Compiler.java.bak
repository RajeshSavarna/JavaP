/*
You are converting an old code for a new version of the compiler. 
In the old code we have used "->" for pointers. But now we have to replace each "->" with a ".".
But this replacement shouldn't be done inside comments. 
A comment is a string that starts with "//" and terminates at the end of the line.

Input specification:
A line of code

Output specification:
New code with required changes.

Sample Input:
t->0; //t-> is a comment

Sample Output:
t.0; //t-> is a comment
